## The Legal Information Gap in India

### Overview

Despite India having one of the most comprehensive legal systems in the world, there exists a significant gap between the availability of legal information and its accessibility to the general public. This creates a barrier to justice and empowerment for millions of citizens.

## Core Problems Identified

### 1. **Complexity of Legal Language**

#### Problem
- Indian Penal Code (IPC) and legal statutes are written in archaic, complex language
- Legal jargon is incomprehensible to average citizens
- Lack of simplified explanations for legal provisions

#### Impact
- Citizens unaware of their legal rights
- Inability to make informed legal decisions
- Dependency on expensive legal consultations for basic queries

#### Statistics
- Only ~5% of Indian population can comprehend legal documents
- 70%+ of citizens report confusion about legal rights

### 2. **Inaccessibility of Legal Information**

#### Problem
- Legal information scattered across government websites
- No centralized platform for legal knowledge
- PDF documents and physical law books are primary sources
- Search functionality limited or non-existent

#### Impact
- Time-consuming research process
- Missed legal protections due to lack of awareness
- Barriers for students and researchers

#### Real-World Scenario
```
Scenario: A woman faces workplace harassment
Challenge: Doesn't know which IPC sections apply
